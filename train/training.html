<p>There are various avenues of training available regardless of your running ability. When I began running I could hardly run more than a minute without stopping. The first plan I started is called couch to 5k. Since then I have looked at<a href="higdon.html"> <em>Hal Higdon's</em></a> half marathon training and Galloway's magic mile.

    <h2><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/" target="blank"></a>Couch to 5k week by week</h2>
    <p>The program is designed for beginners to gradually build their running skills. It is a 9-week program that includes running 3 times per week with a rest day between each run. The rest day is very important to staying injury free. Resting allows your joints to recovery and your muscles to repair and strengthen.
